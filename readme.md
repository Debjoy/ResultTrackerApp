## About

This App works by taking user data and then showing results directly to the users comparing thier performance with previous. This app also shows the overall performance and the strengths and weaknesses regarding thier subjects. You will be able to view and access your marks in an organised manner. 
Entering marks is designed in a way that you can not enter marks more than the number of exams possible with the exam structure you have designed. Each marks requires a particular slot. That means if only there is slots empty you will be able to enter one. There are alert dialogs guiding you in doing this.

## Features

The android app lets you:
- Sign in to to an account and then add marks using you account. This will make your data to be available even if you have to delete the app or change your phone
- Supports any device with android support higher than android Kitkat. 
- Completely ad-free.
- You can change your password from within the app. That will make you sign in again.
