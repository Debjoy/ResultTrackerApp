## About

This App works by taking user data and then showing results directly to the users comparing thier performance with previous. This app also shows the overall performance and the strengths and weaknesses regarding thier subjects. You will be able to view and access your marks in an organised manner. 
Entering marks is designed in a way that you can not enter marks more than the number of exams possible with the exam structure you have designed. Each marks requires a particular slot. That means if only there is slots empty you will be able to enter one. There are alert dialogs guiding you in doing this.
